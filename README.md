# Shibuya's 3D data display by SceneKit

To display city 3D model from [3D city experience lab open data](https://3dcel.com/opendata/).

Inspired from @ToshihiroGoto [SceneKitShibuya](https://github.com/ToshihiroGoto/SceneKitShibuya), I've loaded it with macOS, so it doesn't depend on the iOS simulator that ddoesn't support Metal!

Switch between 2 models from the menu item `Select`:
* Shibuya High Block
* Shibuya M Size 

## Note

Please read the [terms of service]((https://3dcel.com/terms/)) to use the data from 3dcel.
